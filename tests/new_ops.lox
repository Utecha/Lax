// Modulo
print 5 % 2; // Expect '1'

// Power
print 5 ** 4; // Expect '625'

// Pre-decrement
for (var i = 10; i >= 0; i = i--) {
    print i;
}
print "Lift-Off!"; // Expect countdown from 10 to 0 + "Lift-Off!"

// Pre-increment
for (var i = 0; i <= 10; ++i) {
    print i;
}
print "Lift-Off!"; // Expect countup from 0 to 10 + "Lift-Off!"

// Now, I'm not exactly sure how C handles pre/post-crementation.
// Technically, both are supported. However, when used in a for loop, the way
// that post-decrementation/incrementation is handled means that you will end up
// in an infinite loop, as the iterator variable will not actually increase/decrease.
